# Live-microbes-health-app

Optimal nutrition is essential for long-term health and well-being in both children and adults. Poor nutrition can lead to overweight/obesity (OW/OB) and diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, which are leading causes of mortality in large urban centers. Programs and policies have been designed to promote healthy nutrition in the cities, but there is still a gap between research and implementation. Besides the physiological and environmental factors, nutritional status is also affected by food selection and gut microbiota. The latter has a profound role in public health as it is associated with the risk of CVD, OW/OB and immune-mediated diseases (IMD), which are more frequent in urban populations. In fact, clinical trials link IMD risk with the loss of microbiome biodiversity observed in modern living environments3. Foods containing live microbes (LMF) can shape gut microbiota composition, restore microbial biodiversity and impact health. LMF can be found in all food groups (i.e. dairy, fruits, grains, meat). However, a lack of practical knowledge about LMF can limit their consumption, leading to a less diverse and balanced diet. Microbe representation in foods depends on food production and preservation practices, and thus, LMFs are an important link in food systems. New computer science technologies can help understand food systems and the relationships between their components, bridging the gap between different disciplines and providing practical solutions to support healthy lifestyle choices. Mobile applications (Apps) are important in the function of healthy cities, providing innovative solutions that incentivize and guide the population toward healthier and more sustainable nutrition. However, healthy, environmentally friendly, and LMF-aware nutritional practices have not yet been combined in a way that translates research into everyday practice. 

Objectives: This app aims to 1) promote and urge the consumption of seasonal fruit and vegetables while offering tips to reduce food waste and 2) use novel microbiome-oriented food labelling of foods available in large grocery stores in Canadian cities and inform users about their LMF intake.
